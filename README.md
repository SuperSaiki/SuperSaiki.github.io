### 1.【2018-03-17】Perceptron Study

[Perceptron](https://github.com/SuperSaiki/Saiki/blob/master/perceptron.py)

This code contains two ways to make this algorithm. One is to use numpy to build this algorithm from bottom up. The other way is to use sklearn directly and to be a "调包侠". The theory and mathmatics are in the book "统计学习方法" by doctor "Hang Li".

Two references including code and theory from "知乎":
